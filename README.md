## React CRUD project

To run this project you must:

1. Have nodeJS installed
2. Go to root folder, type 'npm install' through the command prompt and wait for it to install project packages
3. Go to 'server' folder, type 'node app.js' through the command prompt and wait for server successful start message
4. Go to root folder, type 'npm start' through the command prompt and wait for the project to be opened in new tab in your browser

### NOTE: I've put timeout in the API methods in order to simulate server response time
